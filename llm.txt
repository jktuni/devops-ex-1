Used tool
OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5)

Motivation / reason to use
Used for sparring purposes. I wanted to speed up the initial scaffolding and double-check my understanding of the exercise requirements.

How and why it helped
Helped me outline the repository structure, create initial Dockerfiles, a docker-compose.yaml skeleton, and minimal example code for Node.js and .NET. It also pointed out details from the assignment text and gave some hints for testing on Windows and Linux.

Mistakes observed
Suggested using npm ci even though I had no package-lock.json, which caused a build error.
Some command examples used old syntax 

Things it was not able to provide
Validation of the implementation. 
Could not guarantee exact behavior in the Linux grading environment.
